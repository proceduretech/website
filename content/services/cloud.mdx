  Cloud infrastructure should accelerate your business, not slow it down with complexity and cost overruns. We design cloud architectures that scale with your growth, stay secure under attack, and don't break the bank, on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

faqs:
  - question: "Which cloud provider should we use?"
    answer: "It depends on your existing investments, team expertise, and specific workloads. AWS offers the broadest services, GCP excels at data and ML, Azure integrates well with Microsoft ecosystems. We help you choose, or design for multi-cloud when that makes sense."
  - question: "How do you approach cloud cost optimization?"
    answer: "We analyze your current usage, right-size resources, implement reserved capacity strategies, and set up continuous cost monitoring. Most clients see 30-50% cost reduction within the first quarter."
  - question: "Can you help us migrate from on-premise?"
    answer: "Yes. We've migrated everything from legacy mainframes to modern data centers into cloud infrastructure. We plan migrations carefully to minimize risk and business disruption."
  - question: "Do you provide ongoing cloud management?"
    answer: "We can. Beyond initial architecture, we offer ongoing optimization, security monitoring, and infrastructure support as part of our engagement models."

## Why Choose Procedure for Cloud

- **Cross-cloud expertise**: We're not locked to one vendor. We design for your needs
- **Cost-conscious**: We optimize for TCO, not just technical elegance
- **Production experience**: We've operated infrastructure at scale, not just designed it
- **Security-first**: Cloud security isn't optional. It's foundational
