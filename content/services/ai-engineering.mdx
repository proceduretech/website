faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between AI engineering and AI consulting?"
    answer: "AI engineering focuses on building and operating AI systems in production, while consulting focuses on strategy and recommendations. We are engineering-focused."
  - question: "Do you work with existing AI systems?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in modernizing legacy ML infrastructure, optimizing model performance, and bringing security and observability to systems already in production."
  - question: "Can you support LLM-based applications?"
    answer: "LLM integration is a core strength. We build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, fine-tune models for domain-specific tasks, and deploy LLM-powered features with proper guardrails and cost controls."
  - question: "Do you provide post-deployment support?"
    answer: "Production is where our work truly begins. We provide ongoing monitoring, performance optimization, incident response, and continuous model improvement as your system evolves."
  - question: "Do you work with startups and enterprises?"
    answer: "Both. Startups benefit from our speed and pragmatic architecture decisions. Enterprises trust us to navigate compliance, security reviews, and integration with existing infrastructure."
