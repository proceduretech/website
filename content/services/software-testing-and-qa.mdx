faqs:
  - question: "When should a startup invest in QA?"
    answer: "As soon as real users, revenue, or SLAs are involved. QA prevents costly production failures later."
  - question: "Manual testing or automation, which is better?"
    answer: "Both. Manual testing uncovers real-world issues; automation protects against regressions at scale. We implement the right balance based on your release cadence and risk profile."
  - question: "Can QA work with existing frontend and backend teams?"
    answer: "Yes. Our QA integrates seamlessly with existing frontend and backend development workflows. We embed with your teams and contribute to your release process."
  - question: "Do you support CI/CD pipelines?"
    answer: "Yes. We design QA workflows aligned with modern CI/CD practices, including automated test execution on every commit or deployment."
  - question: "Can QA scale as our product grows?"
    answer: "Yes. QA strategy, tooling, and coverage evolve as your product and team mature. We adapt our approach to match your growth stage and release velocity."
