faqs:
  - question: "What is Istio consulting and why would I need it?"
    answer: "Istio consulting provides expert guidance on implementing, operating, and optimizing Istio service mesh in production Kubernetes environments. You'd need it when your team lacks deep service mesh experience, when you're adopting Istio for the first time, or when your existing mesh deployment needs optimization or migration to ambient mode."
  - question: "What is Istio ambient mode and should we use it?"
    answer: "Ambient mode is Istio's sidecar-less data plane, generally available since Istio 1.24 (November 2024). Instead of injecting an Envoy sidecar into every pod, it uses a per-node ztunnel proxy for L4 mTLS and optional per-namespace waypoint proxies for L7 features. It's lower overhead, simpler to operate, and doesn't require pod restarts on mesh upgrades. New Istio deployments should strongly consider ambient mode. Existing sidecar users can migrate incrementally."
  - question: "How does Istio compare to Linkerd?"
    answer: "Both are CNCF graduated service meshes. Istio is more feature-rich - it supports advanced traffic management, multi-cluster deployments, Wasm extensibility, and the Kubernetes Gateway API. Linkerd is lighter-weight and simpler to operate, which makes it better suited for smaller teams that need basic mTLS and observability without the operational complexity. We help teams evaluate which mesh fits their actual requirements."
  - question: "What version of Istio do you deploy?"
    answer: "We deploy Istio 1.29 (released February 2026) for new installations and support upgrades from older versions. Istio 1.29 includes ambient mesh improvements (DNS capture enabled by default, multi-network multicluster promoted to beta), enhanced Gateway API Inference Extension support, and improved istioctl tooling. For teams requiring extended support windows, we also work with LTS-track releases."
  - question: "Can Istio work with our existing API gateway?"
    answer: "Yes. Istio handles east-west traffic (service-to-service communication) while your existing API gateway (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway) handles north-south traffic (external clients to your services). For teams looking to consolidate, Istio's implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API can also handle ingress, potentially replacing a separate gateway for some use cases."
  - question: "How does Istio integrate with Prometheus and Grafana?"
    answer: "Istio generates detailed telemetry - request rates, error rates, latency distributions - for every service in the mesh without any code instrumentation. This data is exposed as Prometheus metrics by default. We set up Prometheus to scrape these metrics and build Grafana dashboards for service-level observability. Kiali provides mesh-specific visualization. If you need help with the full monitoring stack, see our Prometheus consulting services."
  - question: "Do you offer Istio commercial support for production environments?"
    answer: "Yes. We provide enterprise support for teams running Istio in production. This includes incident response within SLA, managed version upgrades, CVE patching (Istio and Envoy security bulletins), multi-cluster troubleshooting, and performance optimization. Support scope and engagement model are tailored to your team's needs."
  - question: "Will our team be able to operate Istio independently after the engagement?"
    answer: "That's the goal. Every engagement includes knowledge transfer - runbooks, istioctl training, Kiali dashboard walkthroughs, upgrade procedures, and troubleshooting guides. We want your team confident and self-sufficient. Ongoing support is available but never required."
