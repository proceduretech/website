faqs:
  - question: "When should teams invest in AI security?"
    answer: "Before AI systems reach users, data, or production environments. Early security prevents costly failures later."
  - question: "Is AI security different from traditional application security?"
    answer: "Yes. AI systems introduce new attack vectors that traditional security tools do not address, including prompt injection, model extraction, and data poisoning."
  - question: "Do you secure LLM-based and agentic systems?"
    answer: "Yes. We specialize in securing LLM-powered applications, agents, and AI workflows across design, testing, and production phases."
  - question: "Can AI security integrate with existing engineering teams?"
    answer: "Yes. We work alongside product, frontend, backend, and platform teams to embed security into AI development workflows."
  - question: "Is AI security only for large enterprises?"
    answer: "No. Startups deploying AI into production face equal — often higher — risk. AI security matters when real users, data, or business outcomes are involved."
