  faqs:
    - question: "What's the difference between AI security and regular application security?"
      answer: "AI systems have unique attack vectors, including prompt injection, jailbreaks, data leakage through model outputs, and system prompt extraction, that traditional security testing doesn't cover. We specialize in these AI-specific risks."
    - question: "Do you only work with companies using OpenAI/ChatGPT?"
      answer: "No. We secure systems built on any LLM: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, open-source models (Llama, Mistral), or custom fine-tuned models. The attack vectors are similar across providers."
    - question: "How long does an AI security assessment take?"
      answer: "Most assessments complete in 2-4 weeks depending on scope. A focused red team engagement on a single AI feature can be faster. Full architecture reviews of complex systems take longer."
    - question: "Do you help with EU AI Act compliance?"
      answer: "Yes. We assess your AI systems against EU AI Act requirements, help determine risk classification, and document compliance. We also align with ISO/IEC 42001 and NIST AI RMF."
    - question: "What do we get at the end of an engagement?"
      answer: "A detailed report with findings, severity ratings, proof-of-concept demonstrations where applicable, and specific remediation guidance. We don't just find problems. We help you fix them."
