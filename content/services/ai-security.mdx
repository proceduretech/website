  faqs:
    - question: "When should teams invest in AI security?"
      answer: "Before AI systems reach users, data, or production environments. Early security prevents costly failures later."
    - question: "Is AI security different from traditional application security?"
      answer: "Yes. AI systems introduce new attack vectors that traditional security tools do not address, including prompt injection, model extraction, and data poisoning."
    - question: "Do you secure LLM-based and agentic systems?"
      answer: "Yes. We specialize in securing LLM-powered applications, agents, and AI workflows across design, testing, and production phases."
    - question: "Can AI security integrate with existing engineering teams?"
      answer: "Yes. We work alongside product, frontend, backend, and platform teams to embed security into AI development workflows."
    - question: "Is AI security only for large enterprises?"
      answer: "No. Startups deploying AI into production face equal or higher risk. AI security matters when real users, data, or business outcomes are involved."
    - question: "How long does an AI security assessment take?"
      answer: "Initial assessments typically take 2-4 weeks depending on system complexity. We provide preliminary findings within the first week."
    - question: "What frameworks do you align with?"
      answer: "We align with OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications, NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and emerging AI security standards."
