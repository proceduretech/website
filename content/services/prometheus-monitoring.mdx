faqs:
  - question: "What is Prometheus consulting and why would I need it?"
    answer: "Prometheus consulting provides expert guidance on implementing, scaling, and operating Prometheus monitoring in production. You'd need it when your team lacks deep Prometheus experience, when you're migrating from a commercial tool like Datadog, or when your existing setup has grown complex enough to need optimization."
  - question: "Can you migrate us from Datadog or New Relic to Prometheus?"
    answer: "Yes. We handle full migrations including metric mapping, PromQL query equivalents for your existing monitors, dashboard recreation, alert parity validation, and parallel operation during the transition period. Most teams see significant cost reduction on monitoring spend post-migration."
  - question: "What is Thanos and when do I need it?"
    answer: "Thanos extends Prometheus with long-term metric storage, high availability, and global querying across clusters. You need it when Prometheus's default 15-day retention isn't enough, when you query metrics across multiple Kubernetes clusters, or when you need monitoring that survives individual server failures. Alternatives include Cortex and VictoriaMetrics depending on your architecture. We offer dedicated [Thanos consulting and support services](/services/thanos-long-term-storage)."
  - question: "How does Prometheus compare to Datadog for Kubernetes monitoring?"
    answer: "Prometheus is the native standard for Kubernetes metrics - 82% of container-using organizations run it (CNCF 2024). It's open-source with no per-host licensing fees and gives you full data ownership. Datadog offers a polished managed experience with APM, logs, and metrics in one platform, but costs scale rapidly with cluster size. Most teams with substantial Kubernetes infrastructure find the savings worth the migration effort."
  - question: "What version of Prometheus do you deploy?"
    answer: "We deploy Prometheus 3.x (current latest: 3.9.1, LTS: 3.5.1 as of Jan 2026). Prometheus 3.0 was a major release after seven years, introducing stable Native Histograms, a new React-based UI, OTLP ingestion support, UTF-8 metric names, and Remote Write 2.0. We keep deployments current and handle version upgrades as part of ongoing support."
  - question: "Can Prometheus work alongside OpenTelemetry?"
    answer: "Yes, and this is increasingly common. Prometheus 3.x supports native OTLP ingestion, meaning you can send metrics from OpenTelemetry collectors directly to Prometheus without format conversion. This lets teams standardize on OpenTelemetry for instrumentation while using Prometheus as the metrics backend."
  - question: "Do you offer Prometheus commercial support for production environments?"
    answer: "Yes. We provide enterprise commercial support for teams running Prometheus in production. This includes incident response, managed upgrades, security patching, proactive capacity planning, and high-cardinality management. Support scope and engagement model are tailored to your team's needs."
  - question: "Will our team be able to operate Prometheus independently after your engagement?"
    answer: "That's the goal. Every engagement includes knowledge transfer - runbooks, documentation, PromQL training, and dashboard walkthroughs. We want your team confident and self-sufficient. Ongoing support is available but never required."
