faqs:
  - question: "What is Thanos and how does it extend Prometheus?"
    answer: "Thanos is a CNCF Incubating project that adds long-term storage, high availability, and global querying to Prometheus. It works alongside your existing Prometheus instances - you don't replace Prometheus, you extend it. Thanos ships metrics to cheap object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob), deduplicates data from HA Prometheus pairs, and gives you a single PromQL endpoint to query metrics across all your clusters."
  - question: "Should I use Thanos Sidecar or Thanos Receiver?"
    answer: "Sidecar is the more common approach - it runs alongside each Prometheus instance, uploads data to object storage, and exposes metrics for real-time querying. Receiver is better when you need a centralized write endpoint, when Prometheus can't reach object storage directly (egress-restricted environments), or when you need multi-tenant isolation via the THANOS-TENANT header. Many teams start with Sidecar and add Receiver for specific use cases."
  - question: "How does Thanos compare to Grafana Mimir and Cortex?"
    answer: "All three solve Prometheus long-term storage and HA. Thanos uses a sidecar model that works alongside existing Prometheus instances with minimal changes. Mimir (Grafana's successor to Cortex) uses remote write and is more opinionated about architecture. The right choice depends on your existing setup, operational preferences, and whether you're in the Grafana ecosystem. We'll help you evaluate based on your actual infrastructure."
  - question: "How much does Thanos reduce storage costs?"
    answer: "Object storage (S3, GCS) typically costs 10-50x less per GB than the SSDs Prometheus uses locally. Thanos Compactor further reduces costs by downsampling older data to 5-minute and 1-hour resolution. The exact savings depend on your metric volume and retention requirements, but teams commonly see significant reduction in their monitoring storage spend after moving to Thanos."
  - question: "Can Thanos query metrics across multiple Kubernetes clusters?"
    answer: "Yes, this is one of Thanos's primary use cases. Each cluster runs Prometheus with a Thanos Sidecar or Receiver. Thanos Query federates all of them into a single PromQL endpoint, deduplicating metrics from HA pairs and giving your team a unified view. Your existing Grafana dashboards point at Thanos Query instead of individual Prometheus instances."
  - question: "What version of Thanos do you deploy?"
    answer: "We deploy the latest stable Thanos release (currently v0.40.x as of early 2026). Thanos follows a 6-week release cadence and is still pre-1.0, meaning minor versions can contain breaking changes. We test upgrades against reference environments before deploying to production and handle version management as part of ongoing support."
  - question: "Do you offer Thanos commercial support for production environments?"
    answer: "Yes. We provide enterprise commercial support for teams running Thanos in production. This includes incident response, managed upgrades, Compactor troubleshooting, object storage optimization, capacity planning, and security patching. Support scope and SLA are tailored to your team's needs and environment complexity."
  - question: "We already have Prometheus set up. How disruptive is adding Thanos?"
    answer: "Minimally disruptive. Thanos Sidecar is added as a container alongside your existing Prometheus pods - it doesn't change how Prometheus scrapes or stores metrics locally. The other Thanos components (Store Gateway, Query, Compactor) are deployed separately. Your existing dashboards and alerts continue working. We typically run Thanos in parallel during a validation period before switching Grafana to point at Thanos Query."
