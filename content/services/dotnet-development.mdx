  title: "Our Philosophy on Building with .NET"

  blocks:
    - title: "Product Thinking Over Task Execution"
      description: "We design .NET systems around business workflows, operational constraints, and real usage patterns—not feature lists or time-based delivery. The goal is systems that work in practice, not just on paper."
    - title: "Ownership Is the Default"
      description: "Every .NET system is built so internal teams can understand, operate, and extend it independently. Clear architecture decisions, documentation, and test coverage are treated as core deliverables—not optional extras."
    - title: "A High, Non-Negotiable Quality Bar"
      description: "Quality is not a phase. Code health, testability, and maintainability are enforced consistently so .NET systems remain reliable as they grow in complexity and usage."
    - title: "Designed for Long-Term Evolution"
      description: "We build .NET systems to evolve over years, not sprints. Architecture choices favor clarity, extensibility, and predictable change over short-term convenience."
    - title: "Intentional Technical Debt Management"
      description: "Trade-offs are made consciously, documented clearly, and revisited deliberately. Technical debt is managed as a strategic decision—not an accident that compounds over time."

  company: "Fintech Platform"
  quote: "Modernized our legacy .NET platform while feature delivery continued. The team handled risk thoughtfully and operated like senior engineers embedded in our organization."
faqs:
  - question: "Is .NET suitable for enterprise and mission-critical systems?"
    answer: "Yes. .NET is widely adopted for enterprise applications due to its strong type system, high-throughput runtime, and long-term Microsoft support (LTS releases supported 3+ years). The ecosystem includes mature libraries for security, data access, and enterprise integration. Organizations like Stack Overflow and major financial institutions run core systems on .NET."
  - question: "Can modern .NET applications scale with growing demand?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern .NET is designed for both horizontal and vertical scaling. ASP.NET Core handles high request volumes with minimal overhead through async-first architecture. The platform supports microservices patterns, container orchestration, and distributed systems. Performance benchmarks place .NET among the fastest web frameworks available."
  - question: "Do you work with existing or legacy .NET systems?"
    answer: "Yes. Much of our work involves existing systems—modernizing .NET Framework applications, refactoring monoliths, or migrating to modern runtimes. We use incremental approaches like strangler fig patterns so teams continue shipping features while modernization happens in parallel, without large-scale rewrites."
  - question: "How risky is migrating from .NET Framework to modern .NET?"
    answer: "Risk depends on system complexity and architecture. Well-structured systems with clear boundaries migrate more smoothly. The key is incremental migration—extracting components one at a time and validating each in production. We assess codebases before proposing paths. Many migrations complete in 3-6 months while development continues."
  - question: "Is .NET suitable for cloud-native and cross-platform applications?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern .NET runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is commonly deployed in Docker containers orchestrated through Kubernetes. Azure, AWS, and GCP all offer first-class .NET support. The runtime is optimized for containerized environments with fast startup and low memory footprint."
  - question: "How do you ensure long-term maintainability of .NET systems?"
    answer: "Through Clean Architecture principles that separate business logic from infrastructure, intentional dependency management with abstractions, and comprehensive test coverage. Documentation includes architecture decisions, deployment procedures, and runbooks. The goal is systems that internal teams can understand and extend independently."
  - question: "When should teams seek external .NET expertise?"
    answer: "When systems become business-critical and architectural decisions carry long-term consequences. When modernization is needed but internal teams lack bandwidth. When previous development left fragile code needing stabilization. Or when stakeholders need independent validation before committing resources."
