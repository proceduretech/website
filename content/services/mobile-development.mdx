faqs:
  - question: "Native or React Native—which should we choose?"
    answer: "If you're building a platform-defining experience or need deep hardware integration, go native. For most B2B apps and MVPs, React Native offers faster development with acceptable tradeoffs. We help you make the right choice for your specific situation."
  - question: "Can you work with our existing mobile codebase?"
    answer: "Yes. We regularly join teams to accelerate feature development, improve performance, or help with complex technical challenges in existing apps."
  - question: "How do you handle mobile app testing?"
    answer: "Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, UI), plus real device testing across the fragmented mobile landscape. We set up CI/CD pipelines that run tests on every commit."
  - question: "Do you handle backend work for mobile apps?"
    answer: "Yes. Mobile apps need backend services, and we can build both. A single team that understands the complete picture delivers better results."

## Why Choose Procedure for Mobile

- **Platform depth**: Engineers who understand iOS and Android at the system level
- **Cross-platform pragmatism**: We recommend React Native when it makes sense—not always
- **Performance obsession**: Mobile users notice every dropped frame
- **Launch experience**: We've shipped apps to millions of users
