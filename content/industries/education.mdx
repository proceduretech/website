  Every learner is different—but most educational software treats them the same. We build AI that adapts to individual learners, generates engaging content, and measures what actually matters: learning outcomes. Education technology that works for students, not just administrators.

faqs:
  - question: "How does adaptive learning AI actually work?"
    answer: "We model learner knowledge state based on their interactions—questions answered, time spent, patterns of errors. The AI uses this model to select optimal next content: easier material to reinforce foundations, or harder challenges when ready to advance."
  - question: "Can AI really grade essays and complex work?"
    answer: "For many assessment types, yes—with appropriate human oversight. AI can provide consistent initial evaluation and detailed feedback. We design rubrics and validation processes that maintain assessment quality."
  - question: "How do you ensure accessibility?"
    answer: "Accessibility is a design requirement from day one—not a retrofit. We follow WCAG guidelines, test with assistive technology, and involve users with disabilities in our design process."
  - question: "What about student data privacy (FERPA/COPPA)?"
    answer: "We understand education's privacy requirements. We build systems that maintain appropriate data boundaries, obtain necessary consents, and give institutions control over student data."
