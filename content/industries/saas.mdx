faqs:
  - question: "How do you keep AI costs sustainable?"
    answer: "We architect for cost from day one: caching strategies, model selection based on task complexity, efficient prompting, and hybrid approaches that use expensive models only when needed. We target AI costs below 10% of feature revenue."
  - question: "Can you work with our existing engineering team?"
    answer: "Yes, that's our model. We embed with your team, work in your codebase, and transfer knowledge as we build. You're not outsourcing; you're augmenting."
  - question: "How long until we have an AI feature in production?"
    answer: "Most features reach production within 8-12 weeks. We start with a focused scope, ship something real, and iterate based on user feedback."
  - question: "What about AI reliability for paying customers?"
    answer: "We implement extensive testing, output validation, and fallback mechanisms. AI features need to be as reliable as the rest of your product, and we engineer for that standard."
