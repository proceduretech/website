faqs:
  - question: "How do you ensure HIPAA compliance?"
    answer: "We implement the full technical safeguards: encryption, access controls, audit logging, secure data handling, and BAAs with all vendors. Our architects have specific HIPAA experience and we document compliance at every step."
  - question: "Can AI be trusted for clinical decisions?"
    answer: "With appropriate design, yes. We build AI as decision support, not replacement—providing evidence and recommendations while keeping clinicians in control. Transparency and explainability are core requirements."
  - question: "How do you handle integration with EHR systems?"
    answer: "We have experience with Epic, Cerner, and other major EHRs. We work with your IT team to establish secure integration patterns that work within your existing infrastructure."
  - question: "What about FDA approval for medical AI?"
    answer: "For AI that makes clinical claims, FDA clearance may be required. We understand the regulatory landscape and can help you navigate the appropriate pathway—whether that's 510(k), De Novo, or designing to avoid regulatory scope."
