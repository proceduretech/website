faqs:
  - question: "Can you build AI systems that meet regulatory requirements?"
    answer: "Yes. We build with compliance in mind from the start—audit trails, model explainability, access controls, and documentation that satisfies regulators. We've shipped systems that passed SOC 2 audits and regulatory reviews."
  - question: "How do you achieve sub-100ms latency for AI inference?"
    answer: "We optimize the entire stack: efficient model architectures, optimized serving infrastructure, strategic caching, and data pipelines designed for real-time processing. Every millisecond is accounted for."
  - question: "Can you integrate with our existing trading infrastructure?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineers have experience with common financial data systems, trading platforms, and market data feeds. We build AI that plugs into your existing infrastructure."
  - question: "How do you handle the sensitivity of financial data?"
    answer: "Security is foundational, not an afterthought. We implement encryption at rest and in transit, strict access controls, secure development practices, and infrastructure designed for sensitive data handling."
