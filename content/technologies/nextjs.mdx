faqs:
  - question: "How much does Next.js development cost?"
    answer: "Project costs depend on scope and complexity. Marketing website with CMS (6-10 pages): $15,000-$40,000. SaaS application MVP: $40,000-$120,000. Enterprise platform with integrations: $100,000-$300,000+. Dedicated teams run $20,000-$60,000/month. Our architecture consultation (free) gives you a specific estimate before any commitment."
  - question: "How long does it take to build a Next.js application?"
    answer: "A marketing site with headless CMS integration typically takes 8-12 weeks. A full SaaS MVP takes 12-20 weeks. Enterprise platforms with complex integrations take 20-40 weeks. These assume a team of 2-4 developers and include design, development, testing, and launch."
  - question: "Should I use Next.js or React for my project?"
    answer: "If SEO, performance, and fast initial loads matter, Next.js. If you are building an internal tool or highly custom SPA where SEO is irrelevant, React with Vite may be simpler. Next.js is built on React, so your React knowledge transfers directly."
  - question: "Can Next.js be deployed without Vercel?"
    answer: "Yes. We deploy Next.js on AWS (Amplify, ECS, Lambda@Edge), Cloudflare Workers, and self-hosted Docker containers. Vercel is convenient but not required. We help teams avoid vendor lock-in when organizational policy requires it."
  - question: "What is the difference between App Router and Pages Router?"
    answer: "App Router (introduced in Next.js 13) supports React Server Components, streaming, and layouts. Pages Router is the legacy routing system. For new projects, we always use App Router. For existing Pages Router apps, we migrate incrementally. There is no need for a big-bang rewrite."
  - question: "Is Next.js good for SEO?"
    answer: "Next.js is one of the best frameworks for SEO. Server-side rendering ensures search engines see fully rendered HTML on first load. Combined with automatic sitemap generation, structured data support, and Core Web Vitals optimization, Next.js sites consistently achieve strong organic rankings."
  - question: "Can you migrate our existing React app to Next.js?"
    answer: "Yes. We have migrated Create React App and custom Webpack-based React apps to Next.js. The process is incremental. We convert routes one at a time while keeping your application live. Typical CRA-to-Next.js migration takes 4-8 weeks depending on app size."
  - question: "Do you work with US-based teams from India?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineering team is based in India (Mumbai) with working hours overlapping US EST/PST. We have delivered projects for US clients at ESPN, Pine Labs, and other organizations listed on our site. Communication happens over Slack, daily standups, and weekly demos."
