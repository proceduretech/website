faqs:
  - question: "How much does Angular development cost?"
    answer: "Angular project costs depend on scope and complexity. For reference: Enterprise dashboard or admin panel (10-20 screens): $25,000 - $60,000. SaaS platform with complex workflows: $60,000 - $180,000. Large-scale enterprise application with integrations: $150,000 - $400,000+. Our architecture consultation is free and gives you a specific estimate before any commitment."
  - question: "Should I use Angular or React for my project?"
    answer: "Use Angular when you need a structured, opinionated framework for complex enterprise applications, especially with large teams. Angular's built-in dependency injection, routing, forms, and HTTP client reduce decision fatigue. Use React when you need flexibility, have a smaller team, or are building marketing-focused sites where Next.js adds SSR. We help clients make this decision based on their specific project requirements, team size, and long-term maintenance needs."
  - question: "Can you migrate our AngularJS application to modern Angular?"
    answer: "Yes. We migrate AngularJS (1.x) applications to modern Angular (v20+). This is typically a rewrite rather than an upgrade since the two frameworks have fundamentally different architectures. We use an incremental approach: running both frameworks side-by-side during migration so your application stays live throughout. Typical AngularJS-to-Angular migrations take 3-8 months depending on application size."
  - question: "What is Angular Signals and why does it matter?"
    answer: "Angular Signals, stabilized in Angular 20, is a new reactivity system that tracks state changes granularly. It replaces Zone.js-based change detection with precise, signal-driven updates. This means Angular only re-renders components that actually changed, reducing unnecessary renders by up to 50%. We build all new Angular projects with Signals and zoneless change detection as the default architecture."
  - question: "How long does it take to build an Angular application?"
    answer: "An enterprise dashboard or admin panel typically takes 10-16 weeks. A full SaaS platform takes 16-28 weeks. Large enterprise applications with multiple integrations take 24-48 weeks. These timelines assume a team of 3-5 developers and include architecture, design, development, testing, and deployment."
  - question: "Does Angular work well for SEO?"
    answer: "Angular supports server-side rendering through Angular Universal (now integrated into the core framework). With Angular 20's incremental hydration, SSR performance has improved significantly. However, if SEO is your primary concern and you are building a content-heavy marketing site, Next.js is often a better fit. Angular excels at complex, authenticated applications where SEO applies mainly to public-facing pages."
  - question: "Do you work with US-based teams from India?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineering team is based in India (Mumbai) with working hours that overlap US EST and PST. We have delivered Angular projects for US clients across fintech, healthcare, and enterprise SaaS. Communication happens over Slack, daily standups, and weekly demos."
  - question: "What Angular version do you use for new projects?"
    answer: "We use Angular 20+ with standalone components, Signals-based reactivity, and zoneless change detection for all new projects. For existing applications, we help teams upgrade incrementally from older Angular versions, following the official migration path one major version at a time."
