faqs:
  - question: "What is the typical cost of .NET development services?"
    answer: "Depends on scope and model. Discovery engagements typically run $5,000–$15,000 over 1–2 weeks. MVPs range from $50,000–$150,000 over 6–12 weeks. Full enterprise applications range from $150,000–$500,000+ over 4–12 months. Dedicated teams run $25,000–$80,000/month. We provide detailed estimates after discovery with no hidden fees."
  - question: "How long does .NET development take?"
    answer: "Timelines depend on complexity. Simple APIs take 4–6 weeks. MVPs typically take 8–12 weeks. Full enterprise applications require 4–8 months for initial release. Legacy modernization projects span 3–12 months depending on system size. We work in sprints with continuous releases so you see progress early."
  - question: "Do you offer .NET staff augmentation?"
    answer: "Yes. Senior .NET engineers who integrate with your team: your repos, your processes, your standups. This works well when you have technical leadership but need capacity. For teams needing technical direction, a dedicated team model is usually a better fit."
  - question: "What industries have you built .NET systems for?"
    answer: "Financial services (payment processing, trading, regulatory reporting), healthcare (patient portals, claims, HIPAA-compliant systems), SaaS (multi-tenant platforms, subscription billing), and enterprise (internal tools, workflow automation, ERP integrations). Our engineers adapt quickly to new domains."
  - question: "How do you compare to other .NET development companies?"
    answer: "We're not the largest or cheapest. What's different: senior engineers only, no juniors learning on your project. Ownership mindset, outcomes, not just features. Transparent communication, you always know what's happening. No lock-in, you own everything, easy to leave. US + India presence, timezone coverage and cost efficiency."
  - question: "Is .NET suitable for enterprise and mission-critical systems?"
    answer: "Yes. .NET is widely adopted for enterprise applications due to its strong type system, high-throughput runtime, and long-term Microsoft support (LTS releases supported 3+ years). The ecosystem includes mature libraries for security, data access, and enterprise integration. Organizations like Stack Overflow and major financial institutions run core systems on .NET."
  - question: "Can modern .NET applications scale with growing demand?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern .NET is designed for both horizontal and vertical scaling. ASP.NET Core handles high request volumes with minimal overhead through async-first architecture. The platform supports microservices patterns, container orchestration, and distributed systems. Performance benchmarks place .NET among the fastest web frameworks available."
  - question: "Do you work with existing or legacy .NET systems?"
    answer: "Yes. Much of our work involves existing systems: modernizing .NET Framework applications, refactoring monoliths, or migrating to modern runtimes. We use incremental approaches like strangler fig patterns so teams continue shipping features while modernization happens in parallel, without large-scale rewrites."
  - question: "How risky is migrating from .NET Framework to modern .NET?"
    answer: "What reduces risk: Microsoft's .NET Upgrade Assistant automates mechanical work. Incremental strategies (strangler fig) let you migrate piece by piece. Side-by-side deployment allows old and new to coexist. What increases risk: heavy Windows-specific APIs (WCF, legacy WinForms), tightly coupled architecture, and missing tests (we often write tests first). Most migrations complete in 3–6 months without production incidents."
  - question: "Is .NET suitable for cloud-native and cross-platform applications?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern .NET runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is commonly deployed in Docker containers orchestrated through Kubernetes. Azure, AWS, and GCP all offer first-class .NET support. The runtime is optimized for containerized environments with fast startup and low memory footprint."
  - question: "How do you ensure long-term maintainability of .NET systems?"
    answer: "Through Clean Architecture principles that separate business logic from infrastructure, intentional dependency management with abstractions, and comprehensive test coverage. Documentation includes architecture decisions, deployment procedures, and runbooks. The goal is systems that internal teams can understand and extend independently."
  - question: "When should teams seek external .NET expertise?"
    answer: "When systems become business-critical and architectural decisions carry long-term consequences. When modernization is needed but internal teams lack bandwidth. When previous development left fragile code needing stabilization. Or when stakeholders need independent validation before committing resources."
