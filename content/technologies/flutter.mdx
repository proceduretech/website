capabilities:
  - title: "Cross-Platform Mobile Apps"
    description: "Ship to iOS and Android from one codebase. Flutter's Impeller rendering engine compiles to native ARM code - no JavaScript bridge, no WebView, no compromise. Your app renders at 60fps (120fps on ProMotion devices) with pixel-perfect consistency across platforms."

  - title: "Multi-Platform Apps (Mobile + Web + Desktop)"
    description: "One codebase targeting six platforms: iOS, Android, web, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Flutter's widget engine renders everything itself rather than delegating to platform UI components, so your app looks identical everywhere. Ideal for internal tools, SaaS dashboards, and products that need to reach every screen."

  - title: "MVP & Startup Apps"
    description: "Validate on both platforms in 8-12 weeks. Flutter's Hot Reload lets developers see changes instantly without restarting the app - which means faster iteration during the phase where your product is changing daily. Code-level prototyping, not throwaway mockups."
    icon: "rocket"
  - title: "Custom UI & Animation-Heavy Apps"
    description: "This is where Flutter genuinely outperforms everything else. Flutter's own rendering engine (Impeller, built on Vulkan/Metal) means you're not limited by platform UI components. Complex animations, custom transitions, branded experiences, data visualizations - if you can design it, Flutter can render it at 60fps."

  - title: "Enterprise & Compliance-Ready Apps"
    description: "Offline-first architecture, biometric authentication, role-based access, HIPAA/SOC 2 compliance patterns. Platform channels for deep native integration when you need hardware access Flutter doesn't cover out of the box. Google Pay, BMW, and eBay trust Flutter in production."

  - title: "App Migration to Flutter"
    description: "Move from native iOS (Swift), native Android (Kotlin), React Native, or Xamarin to Flutter. We audit your existing codebase, identify what migrates cleanly and what needs rebuilding, and execute incrementally. Flutter 3.41's improved brownfield embedding means you can add Flutter views to existing native apps without a full rewrite."

    description: "Define screens, user flows, and technical architecture. Choose state management approach (BLoC for enterprise complexity, Riverpod for leaner projects). If you have an existing app, we audit it and plan the migration path. Deliverable: technical spec, Figma wireframes, architecture diagram."

    title: "Design System & Widget Library (1-2 weeks)"
    description: "Build a custom widget library that implements your brand's design language. Flutter's widget composition model means every component is reusable and testable in isolation. Golden tests lock in visual correctness so UI doesn't drift as features ship."

faqs:
  - question: "How much does Flutter app development cost?"
    answer: "Typical ranges: MVP/startup apps with standard UI: $15K-$40K. Mid-complexity apps (e-commerce, SaaS, custom animations): $40K-$120K. Enterprise apps with offline-first, compliance, multi-platform: $120K-$350K+. Dedicated developer hiring starts at $3,500/month. Flutter typically costs 30-40% less than building separate native iOS and Android apps."
  - question: "Flutter vs React Native - which should I choose?"
    answer: "Choose Flutter when custom UI, animation quality, or multi-platform (beyond just mobile) matters most. Flutter renders every pixel itself, giving you complete design control. Choose React Native when your team knows JavaScript, you're sharing code with a React web app, or hiring speed matters - JavaScript developers outnumber Dart developers roughly 20:1. We build with both."
  - question: "Is Flutter production-ready in 2026?"
    answer: "Google Pay, BMW, eBay, Alibaba, PUBG Mobile, and Google Earth all run Flutter in production. Nearly 30% of new free iOS apps are built with Flutter. The framework hit 175K GitHub stars and 2.8 million monthly active developers. Google's 'Production Era' positioning and four stable releases per year confirm this is a mature, actively maintained framework."
  - question: "Can Flutter build web and desktop apps, not just mobile?"
    answer: "Yes. Flutter targets iOS, Android, web, macOS, Windows, and Linux from a single codebase. Web support is production-ready with Hot Reload (stable since Flutter 3.32). Desktop support is stable for macOS and Windows. This makes Flutter uniquely suited for products that need to reach every screen - a companion web dashboard, a desktop admin tool, and mobile apps, all from one codebase."
  - question: "How long does it take to build a Flutter app?"
    answer: "MVP/simple apps: 8-12 weeks. Mid-complexity apps: 12-20 weeks. Enterprise apps: 16-28 weeks. Flutter's Hot Reload, widget composition model, and single-codebase approach typically accelerate development by 30-40% compared to building separate native apps."
  - question: "What is Impeller and why does it matter?"
    answer: "Impeller is Flutter's custom rendering engine that replaced Skia. It uses pre-compiled shaders (via Vulkan on Android, Metal on iOS) to eliminate shader compilation jank - the stuttering that previously occurred the first time Flutter rendered complex animations. Result: 30-50% fewer jank frames during complex animations, faster startup, and more predictable performance. As of Flutter 3.38, Impeller is default on Android API 29+ and the only option on iOS."
  - question: "Is Dart hard to learn? Will we struggle to hire Flutter developers?"
    answer: "Dart is straightforward for developers coming from Java, C#, TypeScript, or Kotlin. The syntax is familiar and the learning curve is manageable. The harder truth: Dart's ecosystem is smaller than JavaScript's. There are roughly 2.8 million Flutter developers globally vs. 17+ million JavaScript developers. If you need to rapidly build a large team, this matters. Working with a consultancy like us solves this - you get a ready Flutter team without competing in a tight talent market."
  - question: "Can you add Flutter to our existing native app?"
    answer: "Yes. Flutter's add-to-app feature lets you embed Flutter views inside existing Swift/Kotlin apps. Flutter 3.41 improved this with auto-resizing Flutter views that adapt to content size - previously, you needed fixed dimensions from the native parent. This makes incremental adoption practical: add one Flutter screen, validate the approach, then expand."
