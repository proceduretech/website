  - title: "Web Applications & SPAs"
    description: "Single-page applications, multi-page React apps, and progressive web apps built with React 19 and TypeScript. We use Vite for fast builds, React Router for navigation, and Zustand or Redux Toolkit for state management. Not every React app needs Next.js. We'll tell you when it does and when it doesn't."

  - title: "Dashboards & Data Visualization"
    description: "Admin panels, analytics dashboards, and data-heavy interfaces with React, Recharts, D3, and AG Grid. Real-time updates via WebSockets, complex filtering, and role-based access. We've built dashboards handling 100K+ data points that stay responsive because the rendering strategy was right from the start."

  - title: "Component Libraries & Design Systems"
    description: "Reusable component libraries built on Radix UI, shadcn/ui, or custom primitives. Storybook documentation, accessibility baked in, and tokens for consistent theming. Your design system becomes a shared language between designers and developers, not a Figma file nobody references."

  - title: "React Native Cross-Platform"
    description: "iOS and Android apps sharing 60-80% of code with your React web app. One team, one language, consistent UI. React Native with Expo for faster builds or bare workflow when you need native module access. We cover the overlap so you don't hire two separate mobile teams."

    description: "React Compiler adoption, bundle analysis, code splitting, lazy loading, and rendering strategy optimization. We've taken Lighthouse scores from 40 to 95+ on production apps. Specific, measurable improvements - not vague 'we optimize performance' promises."

    description: "Moving from jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone, or aging React class components to modern React 19 with hooks and TypeScript. Incremental migration - your app stays live while we rebuild. Component by component, route by route. No big-bang rewrites."

faqs:
  - question: "How much does React development cost?"
    answer: "It depends on scope. A dashboard or internal tool with 10-15 screens typically runs $20,000 to $50,000. A SaaS application frontend with auth, real-time features, and integrations sits in the $50,000 to $150,000 range. Enterprise platforms with design systems, component libraries, and multi-team architecture can run $150,000 to $400,000+. Our architecture consultation is free and scopes your specific project."
  - question: "React vs Angular - which should I choose?"
    answer: "React gives you flexibility and a massive ecosystem. You pick your routing, state management, and build tools. Angular gives you structure - routing, forms, HTTP, and dependency injection are built in. For interaction-heavy UIs, dashboards, and teams that want to choose their own tools, React is the better fit. For large enterprise apps with strict conventions and multiple teams, Angular's opinionated architecture keeps code consistent. We build with both and recommend based on your situation."
  - question: "Should I use React or Next.js?"
    answer: "If your app needs SEO, server-side rendering, or static generation, use Next.js - it's React with a framework around it. If you're building an internal tool, dashboard, or authenticated SPA where SEO doesn't matter, plain React with Vite is simpler, faster to develop, and cheaper to host. Many projects use both: Next.js for the public site, React + Vite for the authenticated app. We help you decide based on what the product actually needs."
  - question: "Can you build mobile apps with React?"
    answer: "Yes. React Native uses the same component model and mental model as React for web. Your team shares TypeScript types, business logic, and sometimes entire components between web and mobile. We've built cross-platform apps sharing 60-80% of code across iOS, Android, and web."
  - question: "What about React performance in 2026?"
    answer: "React 19 with the React Compiler (v1.0, shipped Oct 2025) handles memoization automatically. No more manual useMemo and useCallback. Activity API lets you pre-render hidden parts of the app for instant navigation. Server Components (via Next.js) reduce client-side JavaScript by 30-50% for applicable pages. We enable the Compiler on every new project and have seen 25-40% fewer re-renders on existing codebases after adoption."
  - question: "How long does it take to build a React application?"
    answer: "A dashboard or internal tool: 8-12 weeks. A SaaS frontend with auth, integrations, and real-time features: 12-20 weeks. An enterprise platform with design system and component library: 16-28 weeks. These assume a team of 2-4 developers and include architecture, development, testing, and deployment."
  - question: "Do you work with US-based teams from India?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineering team is based in India (Mumbai) with working hours that overlap US EST and PST. We've delivered React projects for US clients across fintech, healthcare, and enterprise SaaS. Communication happens over Slack, daily standups, and weekly demos."
  - question: "What React version do you use?"
    answer: "React 19 (currently 19.2) for all new projects. We use TypeScript in strict mode across every codebase. For existing applications, we help teams upgrade from older React versions - including class component to hooks migration, React Router upgrades, and React Compiler adoption."
