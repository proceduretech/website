faqs:
  - question: "How much does React Native app development cost?"
    answer: "Typical ranges: MVP/startup apps: $15K-$40K. Mid-complexity apps (e-commerce, SaaS companion): $40K-$120K. Enterprise apps with offline, SSO, compliance: $120K-$300K+. Dedicated developer hiring starts at $3,500/month. Final cost depends on features, integrations, and timeline."
  - question: "React Native vs Flutter - which should I choose?"
    answer: "If your team knows JavaScript or you already have a React web app, React Native is the practical choice. You can share code, components, and developers across web and mobile. If you want pixel-perfect custom UI that looks identical on both platforms, or your team prefers Dart, Flutter may be better. We work with both."
  - question: "Is React Native good enough for production apps in 2026?"
    answer: "Instagram, Shopify, Discord, Coinbase, Microsoft Teams, and Walmart all use React Native in production. The New Architecture (Fabric, TurboModules, JSI) shipped as default in RN 0.76 and is now mandatory in 0.82+. The old 'JavaScript bridge is slow' criticism is outdated - the bridge no longer exists. React Native hits 4 million weekly NPM downloads and version 1.0 has been announced as 'on the horizon.'"
  - question: "Can you build both iOS and Android from one codebase?"
    answer: "Yes. That's the core value proposition. Typically 85-95% of code is shared between iOS and Android. Platform-specific code is only needed for edge cases like deep native integrations. Expo's managed workflow handles most platform differences automatically."
  - question: "How long does it take to build a React Native app?"
    answer: "MVP/simple apps: 8-12 weeks. Mid-complexity apps: 12-20 weeks. Enterprise apps: 16-28 weeks. Expo's managed workflow, hot reloading, and over-the-air updates significantly speed up iteration compared to native development."
  - question: "Can React Native access native device features?"
    answer: "Yes. Camera, GPS, push notifications, biometrics, Bluetooth, NFC - React Native accesses all of these through native modules. Expo provides 50+ pre-built modules covering most common needs. For anything Expo doesn't cover, we write custom native modules using Expo Modules API or TurboModules."
  - question: "What's the New Architecture and why does it matter?"
    answer: "The New Architecture replaced React Native's old JavaScript bridge with JSI (JavaScript Interface), a C++ layer that lets JavaScript talk directly to native code. This means: no more serialization overhead, synchronous communication, support for React 19 features like Suspense and concurrent rendering, and 40% faster startup times with Hermes. As of RN 0.82, it's mandatory - the old architecture is gone."
  - question: "Can you add React Native to our existing native iOS or Android app?"
    answer: "Yes - this is called brownfield integration. Expo SDK 55 introduced the expo-brownfield package specifically for this. You can add React Native screens to your existing Swift or Kotlin app incrementally, without rewriting the whole thing. We package the React Native code as a native library (AAR for Android, XCFramework for iOS) that your native team can consume."
