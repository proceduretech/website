    description: "REST and GraphQL APIs built with Django, FastAPI, or Flask. We pick the framework based on your workload: Django for full-stack apps with admin panels and auth, FastAPI for high-concurrency APIs and AI-serving endpoints, Flask for lightweight services and serverless functions. Not a one-size-fits-all decision."

Model training is one thing. Getting it into production with monitoring, versioning, and rollback is what most teams struggle with."

    description: "Migrating PHP, Ruby, or Java backends to modern Python. We do this incrementally - running old and new systems in parallel, migrating service by service. No big-bang rewrites. Typical migration: 3-6 months depending on system complexity."

faqs:
  - question: "How much does Python development cost?"
    answer: "It depends on scope. An API backend for a web or mobile app with 10-20 endpoints typically runs $15,000 to $40,000. A data platform with ETL pipelines and dashboards sits in the $40,000 to $120,000 range. AI/ML systems with custom model training, serving infrastructure, and monitoring can run $80,000 to $250,000 or more. Our architecture consultation is free and scopes your specific project."
  - question: "Should I use Django, FastAPI, or Flask?"
    answer: "Django for full-stack web applications that need auth, admin panels, and complex data models. FastAPI for high-performance APIs, especially AI/ML serving endpoints that need async and auto-generated docs. Flask for lightweight microservices and serverless functions. Most production systems use more than one. We help you decide based on your specific workload, not framework popularity."
  - question: "Is Python good for enterprise backend systems?"
    answer: "Yes. Instagram serves over 2 billion monthly users on Django. Spotify, Dropbox, and Netflix run critical backend services on Python. Python's ecosystem for web, data, and AI makes it uniquely versatile for enterprise systems that touch multiple domains. The key is choosing the right framework and following disciplined architecture patterns."
  - question: "Can you integrate AI/ML models into our existing Python backend?"
    answer: "Yes. We deploy ML models as FastAPI endpoints behind your existing system, with proper model versioning, A/B testing, fallback logic, and monitoring. We also build the data pipelines that feed model training. The hard part is rarely the model itself - it is production infrastructure, and that is where we focus."
  - question: "Python vs Node.js for backend development?"
    answer: "Python excels at data-heavy workloads, AI/ML, and applications with complex business logic. Node.js excels at I/O-bound workloads, real-time applications, and teams that want JavaScript across the full stack. If AI or data processing is core to your product, Python is the clear choice. If you are building a lightweight API for a React frontend, Node.js may be faster to develop. We build with both and recommend based on your workload."
  - question: "How long does it take to build a Python backend?"
    answer: "An API backend with 10-20 endpoints: 8-12 weeks. A full platform with auth, admin, integrations: 12-20 weeks. An AI/ML system with custom models and serving infrastructure: 16-28 weeks. These timelines assume a team of 2-4 developers and include architecture, development, testing, and deployment."
  - question: "Do you work with US-based teams from India?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineering team is based in India (Mumbai) with working hours that overlap US EST and PST. We have delivered Python projects for US clients across fintech, healthcare, and enterprise SaaS. Communication happens over Slack, daily standups, and weekly demos."
  - question: "What Python version do you use?"
    answer: "Python 3.12+ for all new projects. We use strict type hints across every codebase - they are not optional. For existing applications, we help teams upgrade from older Python versions incrementally, addressing breaking changes and deprecated patterns along the way."
