tagline: "Beyond scripted responses. Real resolution."
description: |
  Chatbots have a reputation problem, because most chatbots are frustrating dead ends. We build conversational AI that understands context, takes action, and resolves issues. LLM-powered assistants that customers prefer to waiting on hold.
problemSolution:
  before:
    - "Chatbots frustrate users with circular conversations"
    - "Simple queries still require human agents"
    - "No memory across sessions or channels"
    - "Integration gaps prevent actual resolution"
  after:
    - "Natural conversations that understand intent"
    - "40-60% of queries resolved without human escalation"
    - "Context maintained across interactions"
    - "Actions taken in backend systems automatically"

  points:
    - "LLM expertise: We know how to harness LLMs for reliable conversations"
    - "Integration focus: Chatbots are only useful if they connect to systems"
    - "Safety-conscious: Guardrails and escalation paths for appropriate handling"
    - "Production experience: We've built assistants handling thousands of conversations"
industries:
  - healthcare
  - education
  - saas
faqs:
  - question: "How is LLM-powered conversational AI different from traditional chatbots?"
    answer: "Traditional chatbots follow decision trees and keyword matching. They break when users deviate from expected inputs. LLM-powered systems understand natural language, handle variations, and generate contextual responses. The experience is dramatically more natural and effective."
  - question: "How do you prevent the AI from saying something wrong?"
    answer: "We implement multiple layers: system prompts that establish boundaries, output filtering for problematic content, guardrails that limit what the AI can claim or promise, and escalation triggers for sensitive topics. Plus comprehensive logging to catch and fix issues."
  - question: "Can conversational AI integrate with our existing systems?"
    answer: "Yes. That's essential for resolution. We build integrations with CRMs, ticketing systems, order management, and custom backends. The AI can look up information and take actions, not just provide canned responses."
  - question: "How long until we have a working chatbot?"
    answer: "A production-ready conversational AI typically takes 6-10 weeks, depending on integration complexity. We start with core capabilities and expand based on real conversation data."
