tagline: "Extract. Classify. Analyze. At scale."
description: |
  Your organization runs on documents—contracts, invoices, reports, applications. We build AI systems that read, understand, and extract structured data from documents at scale. Stop manual data entry. Start making decisions from document insights.
problemSolution:
  before:
    - "Manual document review bottlenecks operations"
    - "Data entry errors corrupt downstream systems"
    - "Important information buried in document archives"
    - "Compliance audits require weeks of document gathering"
  after:
    - "Documents processed in seconds, not hours"
    - "95%+ extraction accuracy, validated automatically"
    - "Instant search across all document content"
    - "Audit-ready with complete processing trails"

  points:
    - "Enterprise scale: We've processed millions of documents for clients"
    - "Domain adaptation: Custom models for your specific document types"
    - "Compliance focus: Audit trails and accuracy validation built in"
    - "Full pipeline: From ingestion to integration with your systems"
industries:
  - financial-services
  - healthcare
faqs:
  - question: "How accurate is AI document extraction?"
    answer: "For well-defined document types, we typically achieve 95%+ accuracy. We implement confidence scoring and human review workflows to catch the remaining edge cases, ensuring downstream data quality."
  - question: "Can you handle my specific document types?"
    answer: "Yes. We build custom extractors trained on your actual documents. Whether you have specialized forms, industry-specific contracts, or legacy formats, we adapt to your needs."
  - question: "How do you handle poor quality scans?"
    answer: "We implement preprocessing pipelines that enhance image quality, correct orientation, and handle various scanning artifacts. For truly unreadable documents, we route to human review."
  - question: "What about document security?"
    answer: "Document processing happens in secure, isolated environments. We implement encryption, access controls, and retention policies appropriate for sensitive documents. SOC 2 and HIPAA compliance available."
