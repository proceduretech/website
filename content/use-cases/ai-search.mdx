tagline: "Beyond keywords. True understanding."

  Traditional search fails when users don't know the right words. Semantic search understands intent—finding relevant results even when queries don't match exact keywords. We build search systems that surface what users actually need, dramatically improving discovery and conversion.
problemSolution:
  before:
    - "Users abandon search after finding nothing relevant"
    - "Exact keyword matching misses obvious connections"
    - "Zero-result searches frustrate users and lose revenue"
    - "Search relevance requires constant manual tuning"
  after:
    - "Users find relevant results on first query"
    - "Semantic understanding connects concepts"
    - "Near-zero empty result pages"
    - "Self-improving relevance with minimal maintenance"

faqs:
  - question: "How is semantic search different from Elasticsearch?"
    answer: 'Elasticsearch (and similar) match keywords. Semantic search matches meaning—understanding that "running shoes" and "jogging sneakers" are the same concept. We often combine both: keyword precision with semantic understanding.'
  - question: "What vector database should we use?"
    answer: "It depends on your scale, latency requirements, and infrastructure preferences. Pinecone for managed simplicity, Weaviate for flexibility, pgvector if you're already on Postgres. We help you choose and implement the right option."
  - question: "How long does semantic search take to implement?"
    answer: "A production-ready semantic search system typically takes 4-8 weeks. We can have a working prototype in your data within the first week."
  - question: "Can you improve our existing search?"
    answer: "Yes. We often augment existing search with semantic capabilities—adding vector search alongside keyword matching for better results without replacing your current infrastructure."
