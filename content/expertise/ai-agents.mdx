faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between an AI agent and a chatbot?"
    answer: "Chatbots respond to queries. Agents take action. An AI agent can research information, update databases, send emails, schedule meetings, and execute multi-step workflows autonomously (not just suggest what you should do)."
  - question: "How do you ensure AI agents are safe in production?"
    answer: "We implement multiple safety layers: action constraints that limit what agents can do, sandboxed execution environments, approval workflows for sensitive actions, comprehensive logging, and rollback capabilities when things go wrong."
  - question: "Can AI agents work with our legacy systems?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineers specialize in building integration layers that connect modern AI capabilities with existing enterprise systems, even those without modern APIs."
  - question: "How long until we have a working agent?"
    answer: "Most clients see a working prototype within the first week. Production deployment typically takes 2-4 weeks, depending on the complexity of your workflows and integration requirements."
