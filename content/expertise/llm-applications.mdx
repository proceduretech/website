  Most LLM demos fail in production. Hallucinations, latency issues, and security gaps derail enterprise deployments. We build LLM applications engineered for real-world reliability—with RAG architectures, guardrails, and observability baked in from day one.

faqs:
  - question: "How long does it take to build a production LLM application?"
    answer: "Most projects reach initial production deployment within 2-4 weeks. We start with a 5-day sprint to validate the approach and build a working prototype, then iterate toward production-grade quality."
  - question: "Should we use RAG or fine-tuning for our use case?"
    answer: "It depends on your requirements. RAG is better for dynamic data and citations, while fine-tuning excels at consistent style and domain expertise. Often, the best solution combines both approaches."
  - question: "How do you handle LLM hallucinations in production?"
    answer: "We implement multiple layers: retrieval-grounding to constrain responses, output validation to catch inconsistencies, confidence scoring to flag uncertain responses, and human-in-the-loop workflows for high-stakes decisions."
  - question: "Can you work with our existing infrastructure?"
    answer: "Yes. We've integrated LLM applications with legacy systems, on-premise deployments, and every major cloud provider. Our engineers embed with your team and work in your codebase."

## Why Choose Procedure for LLM Applications

- **Production experience**: We've shipped LLM apps handling millions of queries, not just demos
- **Speed to value**: First working prototype in 5 days, not 5 months of exploration
- **Full-stack capability**: From infrastructure to UI, we build the complete solution
- **Model-agnostic**: OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source—we use what works best for your use case
