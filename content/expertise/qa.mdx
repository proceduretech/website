faqs:
  - question: "How do you approach test automation for existing projects?"
    answer: "We start by understanding your current state, then prioritize automation based on risk and ROI. We build incrementally, proving value early while establishing patterns for comprehensive coverage."
  - question: "What testing tools do you use?"
    answer: "We use what works for your stack—Jest, Playwright, Cypress, pytest, JUnit, and many others. The specific tools matter less than the testing patterns and infrastructure we build around them."
  - question: "How do you handle flaky tests?"
    answer: "Flaky tests are a solvable engineering problem. We diagnose root causes, improve test design, and implement infrastructure (retry logic, better isolation, deterministic data) that produces reliable results."
  - question: "Can you help with performance testing?"
    answer: "Yes. We design load testing strategies, implement performance test suites, and integrate performance monitoring into your CI/CD pipeline. Performance isn't just QA—it's continuous engineering."

## Why Choose Procedure for QA

- **Engineering-first QA**: We write code, not just test cases
- **Automation focus**: Manual testing doesn't scale—we build automated systems
- **Production insight**: QA informed by production observability and real user behavior
- **Process integration**: We embed QA into your development workflow, not as a separate step
