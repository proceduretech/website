  AI capabilities mean nothing if users can't use them. We design AI products that feel intuitive, where the AI enhances the experience instead of creating confusion. Human-centered design that bridges the gap between powerful technology and real user needs.

faqs:
  - question: "How is designing for AI different from regular product design?"
    answer: "AI introduces uncertainty: outputs vary, latency is unpredictable, and users need to calibrate trust. We design patterns that handle these challenges (loading states for variable latency, confidence indicators, and fallback paths when AI fails)."
  - question: "Do you work with our existing design team?"
    answer: "Yes. We can embed designers with your team, or work alongside them on specific AI-focused challenges. We adapt to your design process and tools."
  - question: "What deliverables do we get?"
    answer: "Depending on the engagement: research findings, user journeys, wireframes, high-fidelity designs, prototypes, and production-ready assets. We agree on deliverables upfront based on your needs."
  - question: "Can you help define the AI product strategy?"
    answer: "Yes. Design and product strategy are connected. We help you figure out which AI capabilities to build and how to position them before jumping into detailed design."

## Why Choose Procedure for Product Design

- **AI-native designers**: We understand how AI works, not just how to make things pretty
- **Engineer partnership**: Our designers work directly with engineers (no lost-in-translation)
- **Research-driven**: We design based on user research, not assumptions
- **Full-service**: From research to prototypes to production assets
