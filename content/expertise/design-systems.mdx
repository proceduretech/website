  A good design system multiplies your team's output. We build design systems that developers love using—well-documented components, consistent tokens, and patterns that make the right thing easy to do. Stop reinventing the wheel on every feature.

faqs:
  - question: "Should we build a design system in-house or use an existing one?"
    answer: "It depends on your needs. For many products, starting with a base like Radix or shadcn and customizing makes sense. For products with unique branding or complex requirements, a custom system pays off. We help you decide and implement either approach."
  - question: "How long does it take to build a design system?"
    answer: "A foundational system (tokens, core components, basic documentation) can be production-ready in 4-6 weeks. Comprehensive systems take longer, but we structure for incremental value—you can use what we've built while we add more."
  - question: "How do you ensure adoption of the design system?"
    answer: "We build for developer experience—good documentation, clear APIs, and components that are genuinely easier to use than building from scratch. We also work with teams during rollout to address feedback and friction."
  - question: "Can you improve an existing design system?"
    answer: "Yes. We often help teams level up existing systems—improving accessibility, adding missing components, fixing inconsistencies, or upgrading documentation. We meet you where you are."

## Why Choose Procedure for Design Systems

- **Engineering quality**: Components built like production code—tested, accessible, performant
- **Designer partnership**: We work with your designers to capture intent accurately
- **Adoption focus**: We build for adoption, not just technical elegance
- **Maintenance-conscious**: Systems designed to evolve without accumulating debt
