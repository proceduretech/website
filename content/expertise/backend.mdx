faqs:
  - question: "Which backend language should we use?"
    answer: "It depends. Node.js for JavaScript-ecosystem teams and I/O-heavy services. Python for data-intensive applications and ML integration. Go for performance-critical services. We help you choose—and we're fluent in all three."
  - question: "Can you help with our existing backend?"
    answer: "Yes. We work with existing codebases regularly—adding features, improving performance, and evolving architecture. We embed with your team and contribute to your codebase."
  - question: "How do you approach testing for backend systems?"
    answer: "Comprehensive testing at multiple levels: unit tests for business logic, integration tests for service interactions, and contract tests for API boundaries. We implement the testing strategy that matches your system's needs."
  - question: "Do you handle DevOps as well?"
    answer: "We're not just writing code—we can set up CI/CD, containerization, and cloud infrastructure. Our backend engineers understand the full stack from development to production."

## Why Choose Procedure for Backend

- **Production veterans**: We've run systems at scale—millions of requests, complex data pipelines
- **Polyglot pragmatism**: We use the right language for the job, not the trendy one
- **Cloud-native experience**: AWS, GCP, Azure—we build for modern infrastructure
- **Operational mindset**: We think about how systems fail, not just how they succeed
