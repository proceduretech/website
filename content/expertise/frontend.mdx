faqs:
  - question: "Do you work with our existing codebase?"
    answer: "Yes. Our engineers embed with your team and work in your codebase. We can join an existing project or start something new—either way, we follow your conventions and contribute to your codebase."
  - question: "How do you handle design handoff?"
    answer: "We work directly with your designers in Figma. Our engineers understand design intent, ask the right questions, and implement with attention to detail. No lost-in-translation moments."
  - question: "What about testing and code quality?"
    answer: "We write tests (unit, integration, e2e as appropriate), follow your code review process, and maintain high code quality standards. We leave your codebase better than we found it."
  - question: "Can you help with performance issues?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly diagnose and fix performance problems in existing applications—slow load times, janky interactions, bundle size issues. We measure improvements with real metrics."
