  Kubernetes is powerful—and complex. We help you run containers in production without getting lost in YAML files and obscure failure modes. From initial deployment to day-2 operations, we make Kubernetes work for your team instead of against it.

faqs:
  - question: "Should we use managed Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS) or self-managed?"
    answer: "For most teams, managed Kubernetes reduces operational burden and makes sense. We recommend self-managed only when you have specific requirements that managed services can't meet—and the team to support it."
  - question: "How do you handle Kubernetes complexity?"
    answer: "We establish clear patterns, automate repetitive tasks, and document decisions. Most Kubernetes complexity comes from over-engineering—we build what you need, not what's technically impressive."
  - question: "Can you help with an existing Kubernetes setup?"
    answer: "Yes. We regularly help teams optimize existing clusters, fix operational issues, and improve their Kubernetes practices. We can start with an assessment of your current state."
  - question: "Do you train our team on Kubernetes?"
    answer: "Yes. Knowledge transfer is part of every engagement. We document what we build, run training sessions, and make sure your team can operate the infrastructure we deliver."

## Why Choose Procedure for Kubernetes

- **Production operators**: We've run Kubernetes at scale, not just deployed it
- **Pragmatic adoption**: We implement what you need, not every CNCF project
- **Day-2 focus**: Deployment is easy—we focus on long-term operations
- **Knowledge transfer**: We train your team to operate what we build
