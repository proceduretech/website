faqs:
  - question: "What is prompt injection and why should I care?"
    answer: "Prompt injection is when attackers craft inputs that manipulate your LLM into ignoring its instructions. It can lead to data leakage, unauthorized actions, and reputation damage. It's the SQL injection of the AI era—and just as dangerous."
  - question: "How is AI security different from traditional application security?"
    answer: "AI systems have unique attack surfaces: prompts can be manipulated, models can be confused by adversarial inputs, and outputs need filtering for harmful content. Traditional WAFs and security tools don't catch these AI-specific threats."
  - question: "Can you secure an existing AI application?"
    answer: "Yes. We can add security layers to deployed systems, though building security in from the start is more effective. We'll assess your current state and prioritize improvements based on risk."
  - question: "How do you stay current with AI security threats?"
    answer: "Our team actively researches emerging attack techniques, participates in red team exercises, and monitors the AI security community. We update our defense patterns as the threat landscape evolves."
