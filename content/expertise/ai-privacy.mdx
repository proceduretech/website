faqs:
  - question: "Can we use LLM APIs while maintaining data privacy?"
    answer: "Yes, with the right architecture. Options include using enterprise API tiers with data processing agreements, on-premise deployments, or hybrid approaches that keep sensitive data local while leveraging cloud AI for non-sensitive tasks."
  - question: "How do you prevent AI from exposing PII?"
    answer: "We implement multiple layers: input sanitization to remove PII before it reaches models, output scanning to catch leaked data, and architectural patterns that minimize PII exposure throughout the system."
  - question: "What about AI and GDPR data subject rights?"
    answer: "We build systems that support right to access, erasure, and portability for data used in AI systems, including mechanisms to track which data influenced model training."
  - question: "Can you make existing AI systems compliant?"
    answer: "Usually, yes. We audit current systems, identify gaps, and implement technical controls to meet compliance requirements. Some cases require architectural changes, which we can phase in without disrupting operations."

## Why Choose Procedure for AI Privacy

- **Compliance expertise**: We've built HIPAA-compliant and GDPR-ready AI systems
- **Technical depth**: Privacy isn't just policy. We implement the technical controls
- **Privacy by design**: We architect for privacy from the start, not as a patch
- **Pragmatic approach**: We balance privacy requirements with business needs
