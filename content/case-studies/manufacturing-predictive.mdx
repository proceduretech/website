## The Challenge

Equipment failures on the production line were causing cascading problems:

- **$2M average cost** per unplanned downtime incident
- **Lost production** that couldn't be recovered
- **Emergency repairs** at premium rates
- **Safety risks** from equipment operating outside normal parameters

Scheduled maintenance based on time intervals was inefficient — either too frequent (wasting resources) or too infrequent (missing failures).

## Our Approach

We implemented condition-based predictive maintenance:

### Phase 1: Instrumentation

- Deployed vibration, temperature, and acoustic sensors on critical equipment
- Established data pipelines from factory floor to cloud
- Created baseline measurements for normal operation

### Phase 2: Model Development

- Collected 6 months of operational data including known failure events
- Developed anomaly detection models for early warning
- Built failure prediction models with 72-hour horizon
- Validated models against historical failure records

### Phase 3: Integration

- Real-time dashboards for maintenance teams
- Automated alerting with severity levels
- Integration with maintenance scheduling systems
- Mobile app for technicians

## Technical Implementation

### Sensor Architecture

- **Edge devices** for local preprocessing and anomaly detection
- **Cellular connectivity** for remote equipment
- **Time-series database** for high-frequency sensor data
- **Data lake** for historical analysis and model training

### ML Pipeline

Multiple model types for different failure modes:

- **Isolation forests** for general anomaly detection
- **LSTM networks** for sequential pattern recognition
- **Survival models** for remaining useful life prediction
- **Ensemble approach** combining model outputs

### Deployment

- Models run at the edge for low-latency predictions
- Cloud retraining pipeline for continuous improvement
- A/B testing framework for model updates

## Results

After 12 months of operation:

- **73% reduction** in unplanned downtime incidents
- **72-hour advance warning** for most predicted failures
- **$12M annual savings** in prevented downtime and optimized maintenance
- **15% reduction** in total maintenance costs

## Key Learnings

1. **Data quality is the foundation** — sensor placement and calibration are critical
2. **Domain expertise is essential** — maintenance engineers know what to look for
3. **Start with critical equipment** — prove value before scaling across the plant
