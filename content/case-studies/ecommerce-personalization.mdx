## The Challenge

Search is the highest-intent feature on any e-commerce site, but this retailer's keyword-based search was failing customers:

- Searches for "running shoes for bad knees" returned irrelevant results
- Zero-result searches were driving customers to competitors
- No personalization meant the same results for every user
- Mobile search experience was particularly poor

## Our Approach

We rebuilt search from the ground up with three pillars:

### 1. Semantic Understanding

Moving beyond keyword matching to understand search intent:

- Vector embeddings for products and queries
- Natural language understanding for complex queries
- Synonym and typo handling
- Category and attribute inference

### 2. Real-time Personalization

Every search is personalized based on:

- Browsing history and past purchases
- Real-time session behavior
- Similar user patterns
- Contextual signals (time, device, location)

### 3. Learning to Rank

ML models that continuously improve result ordering:

- Click-through rate optimization
- Conversion prediction
- Revenue optimization with business rules
- A/B testing framework for safe iteration

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **Elasticsearch** for fast retrieval and filtering
- **Vector database** for semantic similarity
- **Feature store** for real-time personalization signals
- **ML platform** for model training and serving

### Scale

The system handles:

- 50M+ daily searches
- Sub-100ms p99 latency
- 100M+ product catalog
- Real-time index updates

## Results

Within 6 months of full rollout:

- **34% higher conversion rate** from search results
- **$180M additional annual revenue** directly attributed to search improvements
- **2.3x improvement** in search-to-purchase rate
- **45% reduction** in zero-result searches

## Key Learnings

1. **Semantic search is table stakes** — keyword search no longer meets user expectations
2. **Personalization compounds** — small improvements across the funnel multiply
3. **Measure everything** — attribution is critical for proving ROI
