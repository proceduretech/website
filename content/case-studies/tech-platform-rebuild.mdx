## The Challenge

Success was becoming the company's biggest problem:

- **Monolithic codebase** that took 45 minutes to deploy
- **Database bottlenecks** limiting throughput
- **Team conflicts** as 50+ engineers worked in the same codebase
- **Reliability issues** where one bug could take down the entire platform
- **Scaling ceiling** that would block growth within 6 months

## Our Approach

We led a strategic decomposition while keeping the platform running:

### Assessment (Month 1)

- Mapped service boundaries using domain-driven design
- Identified highest-risk components and quick wins
- Established migration patterns and standards
- Built the platform foundation (Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability)

### Incremental Migration (Months 2-6)

Strangler fig pattern — extracting services one at a time:

1. **Month 2**: Authentication service (highest risk, clear boundaries)
2. **Month 3**: User service and API gateway
3. **Month 4**: Payment processing (critical path)
4. **Month 5**: Content delivery and search
5. **Month 6**: Remaining services and monolith retirement

### Optimization (Month 7+)

- Performance tuning based on production metrics
- Cost optimization of cloud resources
- Team training and documentation
- Runbook development for operations

## Technical Implementation

### Platform Stack

- **Kubernetes** on AWS EKS for container orchestration
- **Go** for new services (performance-critical paths)
- **gRPC** for inter-service communication
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **ArgoCD** for GitOps deployments

### Data Strategy

- **Event sourcing** for audit and replay capabilities
- **CQRS** for read/write optimization
- **Database per service** pattern for independence
- **Change data capture** for cross-service data needs

### Observability

- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
- Centralized logging with structured events
- SLO-based alerting

## Results

The transformation delivered on all objectives:

- **10x traffic capacity** with horizontal scaling
- **3x faster deployments** — from 45 minutes to 15 minutes
- **99.99% uptime** — up from 99.5%
- **Independent team velocity** — services can deploy without coordination
- **50% infrastructure cost reduction** through right-sizing

## Key Learnings

1. **Migrate incrementally** — big bang rewrites fail
2. **Invest in platform first** — CI/CD and observability enable everything else
3. **Organizational change is as important as technical change** — team structure should match architecture
