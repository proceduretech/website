## The Challenge

The bank's existing rules-based fraud detection system was falling behind. Sophisticated fraud patterns were slipping through while legitimate transactions were being flagged at an unacceptable rate, frustrating customers and costing the business.

The legacy system relied on static rules that couldn't adapt to evolving fraud tactics. False positive rates were climbing, leading to declined transactions and customer churn.

## Our Approach

We designed and deployed a multi-model AI ensemble that combines:

- **Real-time feature engineering** from transaction streams
- **Gradient boosted models** for known fraud patterns
- **Neural networks** for anomaly detection
- **Graph analysis** for detecting coordinated fraud rings

The system processes each transaction in under 50ms, making decisions before the payment completes.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Highlights

- Event-driven architecture using Kafka for real-time transaction streaming
- Feature store for consistent feature computation across training and inference
- A/B testing framework for safe model deployment
- Explainability layer for regulatory compliance

### Model Pipeline

The ensemble approach allows us to combine the interpretability of tree-based models with the pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning, while maintaining the sub-100ms latency requirements.

## Results

Within the first year of deployment:

- **94% fraud detection rate** — up from 67% with the legacy system
- **67% reduction in false positives** — improving customer experience
- **$47M in prevented losses** — direct, measurable ROI
- **Sub-50ms latency** — no impact on transaction processing time

## Key Learnings

1. **Ensemble approaches outperform single models** for fraud detection
2. **Real-time feature engineering** is as important as model architecture
3. **Explainability requirements** should be built in from the start, not retrofitted
