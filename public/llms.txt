# Procedure

> AI-native software engineering studio. Senior engineers embedded with your team within 2-5 days. We build, not advise.

Procedure is a B2B software engineering consultancy founded in 2017, headquartered in Mumbai (India) with a presence in San Francisco (US). We specialize in AI engineering, full-stack product development, and cloud infrastructure for enterprise and growth-stage companies.

Our clients include Setu (API infrastructure), Pine Labs (payments), KredX (fintech), Treebo (hospitality), and Last9 (observability). We've shipped 100+ products to production across fintech, healthcare, education, and SaaS.

What sets us apart: we embed senior engineers directly into client teams. Same Slack channels, same standups, same codebase. Not consultants who hand over slide decks - engineers who ship production code and own outcomes.
