## 1. AI Engineering Content Cluster

### 🔥 "The Rise of AI Agents: How Modern Systems Observe, Decide, and Act"
**Page:** https://www.notion.so/2fc89071015780509497ca9b7a115c05

**Current State:** No internal links (opportunity for 8-10 links)

**High-Priority Links to Add:**

#### Introduction Section (Add 2-3 links)
Find this text: *"AI agents have quietly transitioned from experiments to real-world production systems"*

Add after first paragraph:
```markdown
Building production AI systems requires robust [AI engineering](https://procedure.tech/services/ai-engineering)
to deploy these agents reliably at scale.
```

#### Main Content (Add 3-4 contextual links)

**Location 1:** In "What Are AI Agents?" section
- Find: *"an agent system that combines reasoning with the ability to act"*
- Link: "agent system" → `/blogs/model-context-protocol-mcp-guide`
- **Reason:** MCP is directly about agent system architecture

**Location 2:** In "Real-World Use Cases" section
- Find: *"AI engineering expertise that spans agent orchestration"*
- Link: "AI engineering expertise" → `/services/ai-engineering`
- **Reason:** Direct service conversion opportunity

**Location 3:** In "Developer Use Cases" section
- Find: *"Code review agents integrated into platforms"*
- Link: "Code review agents" → `/services/ai-engineering` or future blog post
- **Reason:** Specific use case that drives service interest

**Location 4:** In "Healthcare" section
- Find: *"AI agents are being used to assist clinical teams"*
- Link: "AI agents" → `/services/ai-security`
- **Reason:** Healthcare = high compliance = AI security relevance
