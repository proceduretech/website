## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Subtle, Not Attention-Seeking**: Characters should complement the content, not compete with it. They act as delightful discoveries, not focal points.

2. **Contextually Relevant**: Every character placement must relate to the surrounding content. A character near "AI Agents" should be doing something agent-related.

3. **Enterprise-Appropriate**: While playful, characters maintain sophistication. Think "tech company mascot" not "children's cartoon."

4. **Consistent Visual Language**: All characters share the same art style, color treatment, and level of detail.

5. **Strategic Restraint**: Not every section needs a character. White space and breathing room are preserved.

### The "Procedure Pets" Brand Story

The Procedure Pets represent the forward-deployed engineering team:
- **Dogs** = Loyal, reliable, hardworking (like our engineers embedded with client teams)
- **Cats** = Clever, independent, precise (like our AI systems and architects)

Together, they symbolize the blend of dedicated partnership (dog) and intelligent automation (cat) that Procedure offers.

## Color Palette & Style Guidelines

### Character Color Treatment

Characters should integrate with the dark theme while remaining visible and warm:

```
Primary Fill Colors:
- Warm cream/beige: #F5E6D3 (Chip base)
- Cool white: #F8FAFC (Byte highlights)
- Warm orange: #F59E0B (Pixel accents)
- Cool gray: #94A3B8 (Atlas markings)
- Deep black: #1E293B (Cipher, Byte markings)

Accent Colors (matching brand):
- Teal highlight: #14B8A6 (hoodie, badges, glows)
- Blue accent: #3B82F6 (data visualizations, tech elements)
- Gradient glow: linear-gradient(135deg, #14B8A6, #3B82F6)

Outline/Shadow:
- Soft outline: #0F172A at 20% opacity
- Drop shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.3)
```

### Illustration Style Specifications

**UPDATED STYLE DIRECTION**: After iteration, we settled on a warmer, more playful kawaii style inspired by PostHog's hedgehog mascots.

1. **Line Quality**: Hand-drawn, sketchy feel with wobbly charming lines. Visible pen/marker strokes add warmth and personality.

2. **Shading**: Simple color fills with minimal shading. Soft highlights, rosy cheeks, sparkly eyes.

3. **Proportions**: **Kawaii/chibi style** - Big heads, small bodies, huge expressive eyes, blushy cheeks. Cute and approachable.

4. **Detail Level**: Medium detail with colorful fills. Props are cute and iconic (coffee mugs with faces, plants, yarn balls, books).

5. **Poses**: Playful, interactive poses. Characters should be:
   - Playing with each other in groups of 2-3
   - Some doing solo activities (reading, working)
   - NOT stiffly facing camera - candid, natural moments
   - High-fiving, laughing, collaborating

6. **Color Palette**: Warm, vibrant, colorful! Not muted or desaturated. Think cute stickers.

7. **Background Approach**: Use solid #00FF00 green screen for illustrations, then remove background for transparent PNGs that can be placed on the dark website.

### Size Guidelines

| Context | Character Size | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Hero/Banner | 200-400px | Can be larger, more detailed |
| Section Decoration | 80-150px | Subtle, positioned at edges |
| Card/Feature | 60-100px | Should fit within card bounds |
| Inline/Icon | 32-48px | Simplified, may be just head |
| Footer Parade | 40-80px | Multiple characters together |

### Error & Empty States

#### 404 Page - "The Search Party" (Multi-Character Grand Scene)

This is a MAJOR illustration opportunity - similar to the footer parade in prominence. The 404 page should be memorable, shareable, and delightful despite being an error.

**Concept**: "The Search Party" - All 6 characters are on a mission to find the missing page

**Scene Description**:
A wide isometric scene (similar to PostHog's office cubicle banner) showing all characters engaged in searching activities across a stylized digital landscape:

**Character Placements in Scene**:
1. **Chip (Shiba)** - Center-left, holding a magnifying glass, sniffing the ground like a detective dog tracking a scent. Has a small notepad with "404" crossed out.

2. **Byte (Tuxedo Cat)** - Center, floating slightly, eyes closed in deep concentration, surrounded by holographic search queries and floating code snippets. Running an "AI search algorithm" visualized as glowing teal particles.

3. **Scout (Corgi)** - Right side, standing on a small platform with binoculars, scanning the horizon. Has a walkie-talkie and is the "search coordinator." Small clipboard shows a checklist.

4. **Pixel (Tabby Cat)** - Left side, examining a torn piece of "webpage" like it's a clue. Has a detective-style beret. Drawing a sketch of what the page might look like.

5. **Atlas (Husky)** - Background, operating a large radar/sonar dish styled like a satellite antenna. Monitoring multiple screens showing "Page Not Found" in different locations.

6. **Cipher (Black Cat)** - Foreground corner, examining footprints/digital trails with a UV-style teal flashlight. Looking mysterious and investigative.

**Environment Elements**:
- Floating "404" signs like road signs pointing different directions
- Broken/scattered webpage elements (buttons, cards, text blocks) as "debris"
- A winding path/road that leads off into misty uncertainty
- Subtle grid floor suggesting digital space
- Teal and blue accent lighting throughout
- Stars/data particles in the dark background

**Size**: 800-1000px wide, 400-500px tall (hero-sized illustration)
**Position**: Centered above the "Page Not Found" text and "Go Home" button
**Style**: More detailed and polished than other illustrations - this is a showcase piece

**Text Integration**:
- Headline: "Looks like this page wandered off..."
- Subtext: "Our team is on the case. Let's get you back on track."
- CTA: "Return Home" button

**Alternative 404 Concepts** (for rotation/A-B testing):

**Concept B - "The Construction Zone"**:
All characters in hard hats at a construction site, building/repairing a webpage. Chip operating a crane, Atlas carrying server blocks, Pixel painting the design, etc.

**Concept C - "The Space Mission"**:
Characters in a space control room, the "missing page" is shown as a lost satellite. Byte tracking coordinates, Scout on comms, Atlas at propulsion controls.

---

**Empty States**: Character appropriate to context
**Size**: 150-200px (these can be larger as they're focal)
**Style**: More detailed, centered on page

**Loading States**: Simple character animation
**Size**: 48-64px
**Animation**: Typing, thinking, loading bar

    transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut" }
  },
  hover: {
    y: -5,
    transition: { duration: 0.2 }
  }
};

// Subtle floating animation
const floatAnimation = {
  y: [0, -8, 0],
  transition: {
    duration: 3,
    repeat: Infinity,
    ease: "easeInOut"
  }

## Appendix: Do's and Don'ts

### DO:

- Keep characters consistent across all illustrations
- Use characters to reinforce brand personality
- Hide characters on mobile when they compete with content
- Test character placements with real content
- Create high-resolution source files for flexibility
- Document character names and personalities for brand consistency

### DON'T:

- Place characters over important text or CTAs
- Use characters in testimonial sections (keep focus on real humans)
- Overwhelm pages with too many character appearances
- Make characters the focal point of serious/technical content
- Use inconsistent art styles between illustrations
- Add characters just to fill space - every placement should have purpose

---

## Image Processing Scripts

Two Python scripts are available for processing mascot illustrations:

### `scripts/remove_background.py`
Removes green screen (#00FF00) background from illustrations.

```bash
# Basic usage
uv run scripts/remove_background.py --input image.png --output output.png

# With tolerance adjustment (default: 50)
uv run scripts/remove_background.py --input image.png --output output.png --tolerance 60

# Aggressive mode for varied greens
uv run scripts/remove_background.py --input image.png --output output.png --aggressive
```

**Note**: Be careful with tolerance - too aggressive removes greens from characters (elephant skin, plant pots, teal accents).

### `scripts/stitch_images.py`
Stitches two images side by side horizontally.

```bash
# Basic stitch
uv run scripts/stitch_images.py --left left.png --right right.png --output combined.png

# With overlap (negative gap brings images closer)
uv run scripts/stitch_images.py --left left.png --right right.png --output combined.png --gap -400

# With gap
uv run scripts/stitch_images.py --left left.png --right right.png --output combined.png --gap 50
```

## Footer Parade Implementation

### Current Implementation

The footer parade consists of two panels stitched together:
- **Left panel**: Dogs & Cats team (Chip, Byte, Scout, Pixel, Atlas, Cipher)
- **Right panel**: Zoo team (Elephant, Panda, Lion, Honey Badger, Sloth, Tortoise)

**Files**:
- `public/mascots/scenes/footer-left-panel.png` - Left panel with green background
- `public/mascots/scenes/footer-right-panel.png` - Right panel with green background
- `public/mascots/scenes/footer-parade.png` - Final stitched image (used in footer)

**Style**: Colorful kawaii with playful interactions:
- Chip & Byte high-fiving with hearts
- Scout & Pixel playing with yarn
- Atlas studying globe, Cipher reading
- Elephant squirting water at giggling Panda
- Lion laughing with Honey Badger
- Sloth chilling with coffee, Tortoise reading

### Regenerating Footer Parade

1. Generate left panel with green background (#00FF00)
2. Generate right panel with green background (#00FF00)
3. Remove backgrounds: `uv run scripts/remove_background.py --tolerance 50`
4. Stitch together: `uv run scripts/stitch_images.py --gap -100`
