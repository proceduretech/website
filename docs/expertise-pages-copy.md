### FAQs

**Q: Should we use managed Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS) or self-managed?**
A: For most teams, managed Kubernetes reduces operational burden and makes sense. We recommend self-managed only when you have specific requirements that managed services can't meet—and the team to support it.

**Q: How do you handle Kubernetes complexity?**
A: We establish clear patterns, automate repetitive tasks, and document decisions. Most Kubernetes complexity comes from over-engineering—we build what you need, not what's technically impressive.

**Q: Can you help with an existing Kubernetes setup?**
A: Yes. We regularly help teams optimize existing clusters, fix operational issues, and improve their Kubernetes practices. We can start with an assessment of your current state.

**Q: Do you train our team on Kubernetes?**
A: Yes. Knowledge transfer is part of every engagement. We document what we build, run training sessions, and make sure your team can operate the infrastructure we deliver.

AI capabilities mean nothing if users can't use them. We design AI products that feel intuitive—where the AI enhances the experience instead of creating confusion. Human-centered design that bridges the gap between powerful technology and real user needs.

### Key Capabilities

#### 1. AI-Specific UX Patterns
Design interfaces that handle AI's unique challenges: uncertainty, latency, and unpredictable outputs. Patterns that set appropriate expectations and build trust.

#### 2. User Research & Testing
Understand how users interact with AI. Research methods adapted for AI products—testing not just interfaces, but the mental models users bring.

#### 3. Rapid Prototyping
Prototype AI experiences quickly to test ideas before building. From low-fi to high-fi, we iterate fast toward designs that work.

#### 4. Design for Trust
AI needs user trust to be useful. We design transparency, explainability, and feedback mechanisms that build confidence in AI systems.

#### 5. Error & Edge Case Design
AI fails differently than traditional software. We design for graceful degradation, clear error communication, and human fallback paths.

#### 6. Design System Development
Build component libraries that scale with your AI product. Consistent patterns that your team can implement reliably.

### Why Procedure for Product Design?

- **AI-native designers:** We understand how AI works, not just how to make things pretty

### FAQs

**Q: How is designing for AI different from regular product design?**
A: AI introduces uncertainty—outputs vary, latency is unpredictable, and users need to calibrate trust. We design patterns that handle these challenges: loading states for variable latency, confidence indicators, and fallback paths when AI fails.

**Q: Do you work with our existing design team?**
A: Yes. We can embed designers with your team, or work alongside them on specific AI-focused challenges. We adapt to your design process and tools.

**Q: What deliverables do we get?**
A: Depending on the engagement: research findings, user journeys, wireframes, high-fidelity designs, prototypes, and production-ready assets. We agree on deliverables upfront based on your needs.

**Q: Can you help define the AI product strategy?**
A: Yes. Design and product strategy are connected—we help you figure out which AI capabilities to build and how to position them before jumping into detailed design.

### Meta

| Element | Content | Chars |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Title** | Design Systems Development | Component Libraries | Procedure | 55 |
| **Description** | Build scalable design systems and component libraries. Design tokens, React components, and documentation that accelerate teams. | 140 |

### Hero Section

**H1:** Scalable Design Systems That **Accelerate Teams**

**Tagline:** Components, tokens, documentation—done right.

**Description:**
A good design system multiplies your team's output. We build design systems that developers love using—well-documented components, consistent tokens, and patterns that make the right thing easy to do. Stop reinventing the wheel on every feature.

### Key Capabilities

#### 1. Design Token Architecture
Define your visual language in code. Colors, typography, spacing, and shadows as tokens that flow from design to implementation.

#### 2. Component Library Development
Build production-quality React components (or Vue, or Angular). Accessible, tested, and documented for your team to use confidently.

#### 3. Documentation & Guidelines
Documentation that developers actually read. Usage examples, do's and don'ts, and the context that helps teams make good decisions.

#### 4. Figma Integration
Design systems that work in both Figma and code. Changes propagate, designers and developers share a source of truth.

#### 5. Theming & Customization
Build systems that support multiple themes, white-labeling, or customer customization without forking the codebase.

#### 6. Migration & Adoption
Introduce design systems into existing products without stopping development. Incremental adoption that proves value.

### Why Procedure for Design Systems?

### FAQs

**Q: Should we build a design system in-house or use an existing one?**
A: It depends on your needs. For many products, starting with a base like Radix or shadcn and customizing makes sense. For products with unique branding or complex requirements, a custom system pays off. We help you decide and implement either approach.

**Q: How long does it take to build a design system?**
A: A foundational system (tokens, core components, basic documentation) can be production-ready in 4-6 weeks. Comprehensive systems take longer, but we structure for incremental value—you can use what we've built while we add more.

**Q: How do you ensure adoption of the design system?**
A: We build for developer experience—good documentation, clear APIs, and components that are genuinely easier to use than building from scratch. We also work with teams during rollout to address feedback and friction.

**Q: Can you improve an existing design system?**
A: Yes. We often help teams level up existing systems—improving accessibility, adding missing components, fixing inconsistencies, or upgrading documentation. We meet you where you are.
