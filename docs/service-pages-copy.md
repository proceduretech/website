1. **Engineering-Fluent Design**
Our designers understand component architecture, state management, and responsive behavior. Designs are built for implementation, not just presentation.

2. **Research-Driven Decisions**
User research is integrated into the design process, not a separate phase. We validate early and iterate fast, reducing the risk of building features nobody wants.

3. **Systems Thinking**
Design systems that scale with your product. Consistent patterns, reusable components, and documentation that keeps your design language coherent as you grow.

## FAQ Section

**H2:** Experience Design FAQs

**Q1: Do you work with existing design systems or create new ones?**
Both. We can extend and improve your existing design system or build new foundations. Many engagements involve auditing current patterns and creating a coherent system from scattered components.

**Q2: How do you handle design-engineering handoff?**
Handoff is a collaboration, not a throw-it-over-the-wall moment. Our designers work directly with engineers, use component-based Figma structure, and stay available for questions through implementation.

**Q3: What tools do you use for design?**
Figma is our primary tool for design and collaboration. We also use Protopie or Framer for complex interactions, Maze for unmoderated testing, and your team's preferred documentation tools.

**Q4: Can you work without doing user research?**
We can, but we will advocate for research when the stakes justify it. Even lightweight validation like guerrilla testing can prevent expensive mistakes. We scale research to your timeline and budget.

**Q5: Do you design for mobile and web, or just one platform?**
We design for all platforms your product needs. Our approach ensures consistency across web, iOS, and Android while respecting platform-specific conventions.

**Q6: How do you measure design success?**
We define success metrics upfront. Depending on your goals, that might be usability task completion, user satisfaction scores, conversion rates, or development velocity improvements from a design system.
