Examples of Prompts for Image Generation

1. A hyper-realistic digital artwork of this man in the above image, in a red hoodie and gray cargo pants stepping out of a giant 3D smartphone screen. His body transitions from digital particles and glowing social media icons (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram,facebook etc.) into a fully realistic human form. The background is a futuristic neon-lit lab with purple and pink ambient lights, a computer showing a digital scan, and a boxed action figure version The scene symbolizes the blend of technology, artificial intelligence, and human identity. Highly detailed, cinematic lighting, ultra-realism, 8K resolution, sci-fi poster aesthetic
2. Create a photo-style line drawing / ink sketch of the faces identical to the uploaded reference image — keep every facial feature, proportion, and expression exactly the same.
   Use blue and white ink tones with intricate, fine line detailing, drawn on a notebook-page style background.
   Show a right hand holding a pen and an eraser near the sketch, as if the artist is still working
3. Create an 8K ultra-hyperrealistic image of a silver Suzuki Ciaz customized exactly like the uploaded car. Keep the same JDM POWER windshield banner with the same font and Japanese text. Maintain the same front chin/spoiler design, same bumper shape, same grille layout with the chrome Suzuki ‘S’ emblem, and the same headlight structure. Include the same stance, same proportions, and same aftermarket styling found in the reference photos.
   The car is silver with a clean metallic finish, showing crisp reflections, micro-details, and realistic lighting across the hood and grille. Add high-detail texture on the headlights, bumper lines, and body curves. Lowered suspension, subtle sporty stance, and clean OEM+ styling.
   Scene is a dramatic cinematic parking lot or rooftop setting, shot from a slightly high front angle. Use HDR lighting, soft shadows, reflective pavement, and hyper-detailed auto-photography realism. Render with extreme sharpness, lifelike reflections on the windows, perfect chrome texture on the grille, and ultra-clean 8K clarity.”
4. {
   "prompt": "A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic and soft sci-fi lighting. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of holographic glass. At the center is a large glowing logo of {{logo}}, with no additional text or label, illuminated with a smooth gradient of {{colors}}, but not overly bright. The reflections on the card surface should be subtle, with a slight glossy finish catching ambient light. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture or deep gradient with soft ambient glows bleeding into the edges. Add subtle light rays streaming down diagonally from the top, giving the scene a soft cinematic glow. Apply light motion blur to the edges and reflections to give the scene a sense of depth and energy, as if it's part of a high-end tech animation still. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections that mirror the neon edges and logo—slightly diffused for a grounded, futuristic look. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography should have a faint glow with slight blurring, and all elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card.",

5. Envision an infographic designed as a fantastical map of a digital marketing ecosystem. Each platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.) is represented as a unique, miniature floating island with distinctive architecture and inhabitants. Winding roads connect the islands, symbolizing user journeys and marketing funnels. The entire scene is rendered as a hyperrealistic 3D model, with volumetric clouds and subtle lighting effects. The color scheme is a vibrant mix of complementary colors, creating a visually stimulating and engaging experience. The camera is positioned overhead, providing a bird's-eye view of the entire ecosystem, highlighting the interconnectedness of the various platforms. The final image is a hyperdetailed, 4k resolution masterpiece that blends technical information with imaginative storytelling.
