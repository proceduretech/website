# Content Conversion Rules

When converting HTML/design files to the codebase:

1. **Always have source file accessible** - If conversation context was lost/summarized, request the source file again before proceeding
2. **Copy content verbatim** - Don't paraphrase headings, descriptions, service names, or marketing copy. Business-critical text must match exactly.
3. **Verify before committing** - For content-heavy pages, ask user to confirm content accuracy before finalizing
4. **Save reference files** - For large HTML/design files, consider saving to a reference location for comparison

**Why this matters:** Paraphrased content can misrepresent services, change SEO keywords, and create inconsistencies with other marketing materials.
